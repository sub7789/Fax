Stuff Kash needs to do:
Brainstorm a list of potential features to add that can be accomplished within the next 6 months
Add tests using Python's testing library to make sure everything works when we make new iterations (look up Python assert)
Once you've made tests we'll use a separate testing branch
Make the program installable with a single click (package it all and make sure pip installs the required packages)

Stuff we'll both do:
Make a GUI that allows you to press a button to start the program and stop the program (try Tkinter)
